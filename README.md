# NPlusPlusAssistant

N++ Assistant helps with backups and installing community mod stuff for the videogame [N++](https://store.steampowered.com/app/230270/N_NPLUSPLUS/). Only for the Steam Windows version.

Needs Visual Studio Community 2019 with C# .Net stuff installed to compile from source.

## Stuff it already does:

* autodetect main folders (list them, with hot link to go there)

* backup profile, editor levels, replays, sounds, palettes and game levels

* detect if npp is running

* list all profiles listed and select one to replace current one

## Stuff it'll eventually do:

* download soundpacks and select one to replace the current one

* download palettes and select which ones to install

* download metanet maps pack and select one to put on your map levels editor folder (for practice / remixes)

* install/revert community map packs

* edit nppconf

* have an n++ icon
